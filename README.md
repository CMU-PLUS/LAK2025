**Optimizing Human Tutor Training Using Generative AI: A Posttest-only RCT of Scenario-based Learning**

This project explores the application of Learning Analytics (LA) and Generative AI for scalable online tutor advocacy training. It contributes to the Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) community by presenting a dataset comprising lesson log data, human annotation rubrics, and generative AI prompts, promoting transparency and reproducibility.

RQ1: What differences exist in tutor learning, as evidenced by posttest performance, across the pre-instruction activities, i.e., MCQ only, open response only, or both? 
RQ2: Under which contexts, do MCQs, open-response questions, or a combination of both yield the highest accuracy and efficiency, thereby optimizing the impact of the lesson?  
RQ3: How effective is generative AI, specifically the large language models GPT-4o, in assessing posttest performance during tutor training?
